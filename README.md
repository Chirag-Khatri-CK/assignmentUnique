Thought process :

When I received the email I studied about the requirements that is given the google docs and seen the figma design then proceed to the folder structure and all the basic setup needed for the code.
I have used scss with react.js in order to take advantage of features like variables to create more modular and reusable CSS code. And for state management I used redux toolkit which help to make it easier and faster for the codebase and if this needs to be extended then it is easy to do.
